#### 5.1 Schedule

This project consists of three primary deliverables: an architechure prototype, a minimum viable product and the project termination. The architectural prototype should be completed by the 19th of June in week eleven of trimester one. Our team chose this date for the architectural prototype as it signifies the end of the first trimester and the end of the planning stage of the mission control project. After this deliverable has been delivered, the team can begin programming the mission control software, creating a skeleton proof of concept before arriving at a minimum viable product. The minimim viable product for our project is a program that can act as mission control for a hobby rocket launch without any bells and whistles. The minimum viable product should be fully functional, if bare-bones, in successfully allowing a user to launch a hobby rocket. Our team should deliver the minimim viable product by the 14th of August in week five of trimester two. We chose this date as it allows the team sufficient time to create the mission control program while also allowing plenty of time to receive feedback from the client and make changes and improvements the the product. The project should terminate on the 16th of October in week twelve of trimester two. Ideally, the complete version of the product should be finished much earlier and only minor quality-of-life changes should be made the the mission control program in the weeks leading up to the project termination. At this stage there are no plans for any further releases beyond project termination.
