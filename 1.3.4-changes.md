The regulations our rocket needs to follow depends on the motor power range of the rocket.

Motor power range is determined by the minimum safe distance (in meters). 
Motor power range A-D can use the regulations as a guide, E-F need to follow the regulations and G+ need to follow additional regulations as well.

The regulations are specified in the [NZ Rocketry Association (NZRA) Safety Code](https://www.nzrocketry.org.nz/rocketry/rocket-safety).
It is ideal for our software to be flexible (to work with any rocket). Therefore, our software for the rocket should conform with regulations specified for motor power range G+ since if the software is suitable for G+ it will also be suitable for motor power ranges below G.

In NZRA High Power Rockets (rockets with a motor type G or higher) Safety Code one of the regulations states the rocket must comply with the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) Rule Part 101.[3]
So, our rocket must comply with the regulations stated in this rule as well.
