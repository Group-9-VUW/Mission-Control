#### 5.2.2 Procurement

| Good/Service  | Procurement Method | Fulfilment of Project Goals |
| ------        | ------ | ------ |
| GitLab        | GitLab is a lifecycle tool and repository manager and was procured from the School of Engineering and Computer Science. | GitLab was provided to our team from the School. Using GitLab hugely increases the simplicity of collaboration and version management. Additionally, GitLab allows for milestones and epics and allows for pipelines to be added for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). GitLab allows the team to create issues for different areas of the project and assign team members to each issue. Using GitLab allows for the project files to be well organised and maintained and allows for planning and discussion to occur before code is written or commits are made. This results in generally higher quality, more understandable work in both reports and code. |
| Eclipse       | Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) and was procured from [here.](https://www.eclipse.org/) | Several, but not all, team members have experience using Intellij, while all team member's have experience using Eclipse. We chose, as a group, to have all members program the mission control software using the same IDE. Since all team members have experience with Eclipse, we chose Eclipse as our IDE. All team members using the same IDE allows for consistent project files across all member's machines. Having consistent project files speeds up development and integration and increases the likelihood of the team successfully completing the project. |
| Maven         | Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool and was procured from [here.](https://maven.apache.org/) | Using Maven allows for simple library management where library dependencies are declared in a project object model (POM) file. The libraries are located at a central Maven repository and are downloaded when the project is run on the command line using Maven commands (e.g. mvn clean install). Using a Maven project instead of a standard Java project in Eclipse allows for additional libraries to be added and used simply and will result in all team members having the same libraries available to them. This will reduce library conflicts and speed up development, resulting in more consistent project files and a higher likelihood of successful completion. |
| Google Checks | Google Checks is a checkstyle tool used to enforce a consistent coding standard across a project. Google Checks is procured as an option through Eclipse, which will be activated. | Using Google Checks (or any checkstyle tool for that matter) allows for consistency in code style across code written by all team members. Consistency is key when it comes to programming style as consistency and naming conventions are some of the primary parts of the understandability of code. As such, using Google Checks should allow our team to produce code that is consistent in style and is easily understandable. |
| OpenStreetMap | OpenStreetMap is a //TODO collaborative project?. OpenStreetMap was procurred using an API? An example of a tile returned from the API can be found [here.](https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/16/64587/41035.png) | Using OpenStreetMap allows for our program to dynamically request map tiles at runtime, stitch the map together into a single image, save and load the image from a file and display the image as a map to the user. The primary purpose of using OpenStreetMap for our project is to allow for a map with the rocket's location and landing site to be displayed graphically to the user, greatly increasing the user experience. |
| NOAA          | NOAA is a weather data provider that can be used to obtain a variety of local weather data such as temperature, windspeed and precipitation. NOAA data is procured by the program from the official [NOAA website](https://www.noaa.gov/) using an API. | NOAA, or a similar weather data provider is absolutely essential for the program. The program will get the current local weather data (or a forecast of the near future) from NOAA. This data is needed by the Monte Carlo simulator in order to perform accurate simulations of the rocket's flight. Using NOAA allows for the program to determine whether it is safe to launch the rocket or not, thanks to the Monte Carlo simulations. |
