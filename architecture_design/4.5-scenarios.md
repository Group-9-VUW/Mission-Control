Scenario 1:  
Weather data from NOAA  
Everything goes smoothly  
  
Scenario 2:  
Weather data entered in manually  
Probable landing locations return low prob  
Go no go says nah  
User changes launch angle  
Probable landing locations return higher prob  
Go no go says yea  
Launch commences  
  
Scenario 3:  
Exact same as scenario 1 except pre-launch checks fail so rocket doesn't launch  
  
Scenario 4:  
Probablilities are medium  
Go no go just passes but probab still on the low side  
Launcher decides to cancel the launch as they personally think the launch is too risky  
  
  
The scenarios described below revolve around two of our most important use-cases, "Determine probable landing locations" and "Go/no-go function".  
These two use-cases are described in detail in the [Project Requirements document](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/engr300/2020/group9/group-9/-/blob/master/project_requirement/project-requirement.md) under Section 3.2.  
These two use-cases were chosen because they are very essential as they are both required for the minimum viable product.  
  
*Scenario 1*  
Launcher (individual responsible for launching the rocket) indicates to the system that they intend to launch the rocket. The rocket then determines the probable landing locations by using the GPS coordinates of the rocket to get the local weather data from NOAA. This data is then sent to the monte-carlo simulation which calculates and returns a set of probable landing locations.  
In this scenario the rocket is positioned in a very spacious area and the local weather data indicates that it is a sunny day, with minimal clouds and very low wind therefore the monte-carlo simulation responds with many landing locations with each location have a high probablility of being acceptable/safe.
These locations are displayed to the launcher via the GUI. Immediately after this, the Go/no-go function receives these locations and their probabilities and compares this to an already established tolerance. Because the probabilities of the landing locations are high the Go/no-go function returns a Go signal which is displayed to the launcher (the launcher is told launching can commence).
Pre-launch checks are successfuly performed and all pass so a launch signal to the rocket is sent. The rocket then launches after a countdown.
