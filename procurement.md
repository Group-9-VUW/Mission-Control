#### 5.2.2 Procurement

| Good/Service  | Procurement Method | Fulfilment of Project Goals |
| ------        | ------ | ------ |
| GitLab        | GitLab is a lifecycle tool and repository manager and was procured from the School of Engineering and Computer Science. | GitLab was provided to our team from the School. Using GitLab hugely increases the simplicity of collaboration and version management. Additionally, GitLab allows for milestones and epics and allows for pipelines to be added for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). GitLab allows the team to create issues for different areas of the project and assign team members to each issue. Using GitLab allows for the project files to be well organised and maintained and allows for planning and discussion to occur before code is written or commits are made. This results in generally higher quality, more understandable work in both reports and code. |
| Eclipse       | Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) and was procured from [here.](https://www.eclipse.org/) | Several, but not all, team members have experience using Intellij, while all team member's have experience using Eclipse. We chose, as a group, to have all members program the mission control software using the same IDE. Since all team members have experience with Eclipse, we chose Eclipse as our IDE. All team members using the same IDE allows for consistent project files across all member's machines. Having consistent project files speeds up development and integration and increases the likelihood of the team successfully completing the project. |
| Maven         | Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool and was procured from [here.](https://maven.apache.org/) | Using Maven allows for simple library management where library dependencies are declared in a project object model (POM) file. The libraries are located at a central Maven repository and are downloaded when the project is run on the command line using Maven commands (e.g. mvn clean install). Using a Maven project instead of a standard Java project in Eclipse allows for additional libraries to be added and used simply and will result in all team members having the same libraries available to them. This will reduce library conflicts and speed up development, resulting in more consistent project files and a higher likelihood of successful completion. |
| Google Checks | Google Checks is a checkstyle tool used to enforce a consistent coding standard across a project. Google Checks is procured as an option through Eclipse, which will be activated. | Using Google Checks (or any checkstyle tool for that matter) allows for consistency in code style across code written by all team members. Consistency is key when it comes to programming style as consistency and naming conventions are some of the primary parts of the understandability of code. As such, using Google Checks should allow our team to produce code that is consistent in style and is easily understandable. |


<br><br>
Present a table of goods or services that will be required to deliver project goals and specify how they are to be procured (e.g. from the School or from an external organisation).<br>
These may be software applications, libraries, training or other infrastructure, including open source software. <br>
Justify and substantiate procurement with reference to fulfilment of project goals, one paragraph per item.
